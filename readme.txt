This is a spider for www.neitui.me wrote by Arnold.Hu.
This spider is wrote to get hr imformation.
This is a toy program.


How to use:
you could clone it and open this folder. Then there is a subfolder also name "neituiwang" and a file name scrapy.cfg . Ok, now you can type "scrapy crawl neituiwang -o filename.(json\csv\XML\jasonlines)" to get the data in this directory. filename.(json\csv\XML\jasonlines) is the file your data in. you could rename the filename like dog, cat, girlfriend, banananananana and what ever you like and choose a method( or different file type) to store your data. 

tips: 
1. Json is convinient for many language as a standard data type, also csv is easy to be open by excel directly.
2. In items.py and neituiwangspider.py the data of requirement were commented because it have paragraphys of letters. If you want this part of data, just off the comment symbol(the "#"), and do the "How to use:" again(remenber to off the commnent in both file!).
3. This spider could spent about a hours to get the aim data, and at the end you could get about 30000+ hr imformation. So, I advise you to cook your dinner or jog for an hour. :)
